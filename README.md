## Technical Documentation

### GETTING STARTED

Accuweather-forecast was created using the Vue.js JavaScript framework. It makes use of different JavaScript libraries that allow the app to function and be developed in a structured manner. The frontend utilizes the Axios HTTP client to communicate with the Accuweather API. It also uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### INSTALLATION AND DEVELOPMENT

The user must first install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment for development, building, and deployment. Installation of this includes the [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/), which helps install external libraries needed for the app to function.

This project was created with **Node.js version 16.16.0**.

The Vue.js 3 framework was used for this project, and a guide for it can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#what-is-vue). The app uses the Options API.

Lastly, the user must have a text editor. The developers suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

[Vue Language Features (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) - Language support for Vue 3  
[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - Intelligent Tailwind CSS tooling for VS Code.

### LIBRARIES

[**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility first CSS framework that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

[**Dayjs**](https://day.js.org/en/) - A minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times for modern browsers with a largely Moment.js-compatible API.

[**Axios**](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - A promise-based HTTP Client for node.js
